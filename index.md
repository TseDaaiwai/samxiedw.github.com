## Research Experience

I have participated in scientific research for about 3.5 years, and I am familiar with basic work such as paper retrieval and 
experiment reproduction. The research direction I have participated in can be roughly divided into three parts:

- **Photoelectronic detector (09/2018 - 07/2021)**<br>
　I joined Professor Mai Wenjie’s research group in the Department of Physics of Jinan University in the second year of my 
 undergraduate. I participated in the research of photoelectronic detectors, mainly involved in device preparation and 
 characterization, and published two papers in ACSAMI and Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics. The research direction of 
 my graduation thesis is related to lead-free perovskite photodetectors.
 
- **Wireless communication system (07/2020 - 08/2020)**<br>
　Summer school project, took the course "Wireless Communication System Design" with Professor Danijela Cabric from the 
 Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering at UCLA, and completed the course paper "Deep Learning Based Multi-communication 
 Technique Classification with Radio Fingerprint Recognition” (see attachment) and published in International Core Journal of 
 Engineering. This project exposed me to wireless communication technologies from scratch and is one of the reasons for my interest 
 in electronic engineering.

- **Graduate Thesis (09/2020 - 07/2021)**<br>
　"Research on Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite photodetector with nano-nickel oxide as hole transport layer"

- **Super-resolution microscopy and imaging (09/2021 - 05/2022)**<br>
　After graduation, I joined Associate Professor Li Yiming's research group in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at SUSTech as a research assistant. 
 I participate in the research of super-resolution microscope systems and mainly involved in the construction of interferometric scattering imaging system 
 and the maintenance of the electronic system and optical path of the original microscope system.
